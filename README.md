# **Navigation algorithm for space rendezvous and docking** 

> **A service or chaser spacecraft from 100 km away moves towards a target and has sensors such as GPS, IMU, LIDAR and star tracker. It uses an unscented Kalman filter to better estimate system state. The algorithm runs the dynamics of the system in phases from 100 km to 5 km, 5 km to 2 m, and 2 m to docking (terminal conditions)**
